Airline Safety Clustering Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline safety using K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering techniques. The objective is to classify airlines based on safety metrics and visualize the clustering results.

Introduction
This project aims to analyze and cluster airlines based on various safety metrics collected over different periods. We utilize K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to classify airlines and visualize the results to identify patterns and insights.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is airline-safety.csv, which contains the following columns:

airline
avail_seat_km_per_week
incidents_85_99
fatal_accidents_85_99
fatalities_85_99
incidents_00_14
fatal_accidents_00_14
fatalities_00_14
Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels

Results
The analysis produces visualizations and clustering results that classify airlines based on their safety metrics. Key visualizations include:

Scatter plots of clusters with circled cluster boundaries.
Safety metrics comparison across different clusters.
